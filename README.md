### [Vehicle & Pedestrians Investigations](vehicle_and_pedestrians_investigations/)

The Notebook in [vehicle_and_pedestrians_investigations/](vehicle_and_pedestrians_investigations/)  generates plots of data queried from [Vehicle & Pedestrian Investigations Dataset](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/vehicle-pedestrian-investigations/) and saves the image in the directory. The following categories are available:

- Stops by Age and Race (saved as stops_by_age_and_race.png)
- Stops by Gender and Race (saved as stops_by_gender_and_race.png)
- Stops by Stop Type and Race (saved as stops_by_stoptype_and_race.png)
